Doodle Pad is one of the first Google Chrome extensions that I have completed. It is made using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON similar to websites. The drawing area was made up by populating a 400×400px canvas with 10×10px tiles which all react to mouse events. The color palette and tools are all made using the same method as the canvas; using tiles. The color palette works by getting the “fillStyle” attribute from the tile the user clicks on, thus changing the active pen color to the “fillStyle” provided. The save button converts the 400×400px canvas into a “.png” file and saves it to the user’s downloads as a user-defined name when clicked. The paint bucket tool takes in the color of the tile that the user clicks with the paint bucket active, then converts every tile on the canvas that is the same color as the tile that was clicked into the new color. The eye dropper tool works similarly to the paint bucket but just receives the color of the tile clicked and sets the active color to it. The undo and redo tool keeps track of the last moves the player makes and allows for undo and redo for up to one step.

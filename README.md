Doodle Pad is one of the first Google Chrome extensions that I completed. It is made using a combination of; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON similarly to websites.

The drawing area was made up by populating a 400×400px canvas with 20×20px tiles which all react to mouse events. The color palette, eraser, and save button are made using the same method as the canvas works by getting the “fillStyle” attribute from the tile the user clicks on, thus changing the active pen color. The save button converts the 400×400px canvas into a “.png” file and saves to the users downloads when clicked.
